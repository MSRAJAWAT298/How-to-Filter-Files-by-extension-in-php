	<li> :point_right: The code starts by setting the maximum execution time to 0.</li>
    <li> :point_right: This means that the script will not stop running until it has finished executing all of its instructions.</li>
    <li> :point_right: Next, a variable called $moveFileNames is created and initialized with an empty array.</li>
    <li> :point_right: The code then iterates through each directory in the current working directory (M:/Mayank singh/) and checks if any files are present in that directory using is_file().</li>
    <li> :point_right: If there are files present, then they are checked for extensions using pathinfo() function.</li>
    <li> :point_right: If no extension is found, then continue checking other directories; otherwise, if an extension exists in the list of skipped file extensions ($skipFilesExtenion), </li>
    <li> :point_right: then skip this folder and move on to check other folders.</li>
    <li> :point_right: If a folder does exist with no files or if it's a file without an extension, then we need to create a new folder at M:/Mayank singh/image-Type-extension/.</li>
    <li> :point_right: Then we need to rename our source file from M:/Mayank singh/image-Type-extension/image1.jpg to image1@2x~3dpi~transparent~RGB24bit@300ppi~jpeg2000@0kbpixlesize@Loss</li>
    <li> :point_right: The code is a PHP function that filters files in the directory M:/Mayank singh/</li>
